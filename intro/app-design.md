# Modularity and Application Design

Now that we know what npm is -- a fair question is "*why* npm?"

## Modularity

Modularity is a software architecture concept that pertains to
the degree to which a system's components may be separated and
recombined.

Benefits of modularity include:

- easier to maintain
- easier to test
- easier to reason about

Problems:

- locating and using modules is difficult
- updating modules is difficult
