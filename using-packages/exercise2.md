# Exercise 2: Installing Packages and Using Packages with Node.js

## Learning Objectives

- install a package using npm
- use package in a Node.js program using `require`

## Prerequisites

- you should have Node.js >= v4 installed
- you should have npm v2 or v3 installed

## Instructions

1. Create a directory called `my-project`
2. Change into that directory using `cd my-project`
3. Install the `my-first-mod`
4. Create a file called `index.js`
5. Use the `my-first-mod` to add the numbers 3 and 4
6. Use the `my-first-mod` to have the console print "Hello, <your name>!"

## Hints

- You can use `http://npmjs.com` to look at the `README` of a package.
  A `README` will often give you information on how to use the package.
- You can use `console.log(<string>)` to print things to the console
  with Node.js, where `<string>` is a set of characters or a variable
  that contains a set of characters
- You can run a Node.js program by typing `node <js-file-name>` where
  `js-file-name` is the name of a `.js` file, e.g. `index`, `index.js`
